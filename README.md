# Story telling with data

Any data visualization tool can create a graph to show your data  but none of them knows your data or organozation like you do. Exploring storytelling with data enables you to bring your data to live.

## Choosing an effective visual

* Simple text  - If you have a number or 2 to communicate , use the numbers and make them prominent with a few supporting words to make your point. Putting only a couple of numbers in a graph or table simply makes them loose their oomph.
  * Use color intentionally
  * Leverage font size to help aid your poitn

* Tables - Tables are good for communicating with audiences whose members will each look for their rows of interest or communicating different units of measure
  * Avoid using tables in live presentation - odds are there is a better way to pull out and visualize the pieces or piece of interest. If you are loosing too much by this , consider including the full table in the appendix and use a link or reference to it
  * The table design should fade into the background , data takes center stage
  * Use light borders, greyed out or remove them and use white space to set apart table elements
  
* Heat Maps - This is a special case of tables that leverages colored cells to convey the relative magnitude of the numbers
  * Always include a legende - e.g a low to hugh subtitle with respective colors

A well designed graph will always get information across quickly than a well designed table

* Scatter Plot - Effective for showing relationships between two things
  * Consider your intention and what you want to draw attention to and leverage color, text and font size

* Line graph - very effective for plotting continous data , often some unit of time (days,months , quarters, years)
  * standard line graph - can show  one , two or multiple series of data
  * Slope graph - effective for showing relative increases/ decreases /differences across various categories when you have 2 periods or points of comparison
  
  * Data plotted should always be in consistent intervals
  * If plotting a summary statistic like an average or point estimate of a forecast , consider also visualizig the range
  * If many lines overlap in a slope graph , consider using another chart type or using color to emphasize important categories
  
* Bar charts - bars should be a go to chart when plotting categorical data where information is organized in groups.




  * They should always have a zero baseline
  * Y axis labels should be on the left side of the visual
  * Data labels should be inside bars to reduce clutter
  * If data labels are outside , omit Y axis labels to reduce redundancy
  * When chosing between axis and data labels- consider level of specificity you need:
    * If intent is to show big picture trends , preserve both labels and de-emphasize axis labels , grey them out
    * If intent is to emphasize on specific numerical values , keep data labels and omit axis labels
  * Bar width should always be wider than the whitespace between them but not too wide as this risks width comparisons by your audience
