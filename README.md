# Story telling with data

Any data visualization tool can create a graph to show your data  but none of them knows your data or organozation like you do. Exploring storytelling with data enables you to bring your data to live.

## Choosing an effective visual

* Simple text  - If you have a number or 2 to communicate , use the numbers and make them prominent with a few supporting words to make your point. Putting only a couple of numbers in a graph or table simply makes them loose their oomph.
  * Use color intentionally
  * Leverage font size to help aid your poitn

* Tables - Tables are good for communicating with audiences whose members will each look for their rows of interest or communicating different units of measure
  * Avoid using tables in live presentation - odds are there is a better way to pull out and visualize the pieces or piece of interest. If you are loosing too much by this , consider including the full table in the appendix and use a link or reference to it
  * The table design should fade into the background , data takes center stage
  * Use light borders, greyed out or remove them and use white space to set apart table elements
  *
